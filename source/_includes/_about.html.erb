      <p>I am a London based Designer currently working at technology startup <a href="http://listora.com" target='_blank'>Listora</a>. I have a passion for design that transcends medium (but to be honest, I do spend most of my time making websites).</p>
      <p>I am an accomplished Front-End Developer / Designer and enjoy turning ideas into realities.
      <p>But hey, don't take my word for it. Have alook at some of my <a href="#work">recent projects below</a>.</p>
